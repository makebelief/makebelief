### Overview

This project is an ASCII art program implemented in Go. It takes a string as input and outputs a graphic representation of the string using ASCII characters. The output resembles the input string with ASCII characters.

### Features

- Handles input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and newlines.
- Supports various graphical templates using ASCII characters.
- Written in Go with adherence to good practices.
- Includes test files for unit testing.

### Banner Formats

The ASCII banner files included in the project have specific graphical representations formatted in ASCII. Each character has a height of 8 lines, and characters are separated by a newline (\n) character.

The following banner formats are included:
- `shadow`
- `standard`
- `thinkertoy`

### Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
go run . "<your_string>"
```

For example:

```bash
go run . "Hello"
```

### Example Outputs

Here are some example outputs generated by the program:

```
