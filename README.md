![Go-Logo_Blue-removebg-preview(2)](https://github.com/makebelief/makebelief/assets/166484145/ad53f422-f338-4dd7-9ef1-ab772aa1fbb5)
### Overview

This project is an ASCII art program implemented in Go. It takes a string as input and outputs a graphic representation of the string using ASCII characters. The output resembles the input string with ASCII characters.
### Content
- main.go
- testfile
- go.mod
- shadow.txt
- standard.txt
- thinktoy.txt
- printart.go
- readbyline.go
- readtxtfile.go
### Features

- Handles input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and newlines.
- Supports various graphical templates using ASCII characters.
- Written in Go with adherence to good practices.
- Includes test files for unit testing.

### Banner Formats

The ASCII banner files included in the project have specific graphical representations formatted in ASCII. Each character has a height of 8 lines, and characters are separated by a newline (\n) character.

The following banner formats are included:
- `shadow`
- `standard`
- `thinkertoy`

### Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
go run . "<your_string>"
```

For example:

```bash
go run . "Hello"
```

### Example Outputs
